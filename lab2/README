ELE784 - Lab1 charDriver kernel module
======================================
(this file does not use markdown formatting)


To compile the project:
=======================
    1. make charDriver (for charDriver module only)
    2. make testchardriver (for user app only)
    3. make all (for both)
    4. make clean (to clean build)


Project directory structure:
============================
.
├── README (this file)
└── src
    ├── charDriver.c (source code for driver)
    ├── charDriver.h (header file)
    ├── circularBuffer.c
    ├── circularBuffer.h
    ├── Makefile
    └── testchardriver.c (user application)

Known bugs and limitation:
==========================
    1. Test app does not do any sanition on user input therefore do not feed it unexpected data.
    2. Test app in write mode: user input cannot contain whitespace characters.
    3. No instructions provided with test app as it is very verbose and straightforward to use.
